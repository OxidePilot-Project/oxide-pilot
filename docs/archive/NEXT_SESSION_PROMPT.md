## 🎯 Specific Tasks for Next Session

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Test Installer Package**
   ```bash
   # Run the installer creation
   ./create-installer.bat
   
   # Test on clean Windows VM
   # Verify all components install correctly
   # Test uninstaller functionality
   ```

2. **Code Signing Setup**

   - Set up code signing infrastructure
   - Sign the executable and installer

3. **Antivirus Submission**
   - Use materials in `installer-package/antivirus/`
   - Submit to Windows Defender, Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky
   - Track submission status and responses

### Development Tasks (Week 2-3)

4. **Automatic Updates**
   ```rust
   // Implement in oxide-core/src/updater.rs
   pub struct UpdateManager {
       current_version: Version,
       update_server: String,
       auto_update_enabled: bool,
   }
   
   impl UpdateManager {
       pub async fn check_for_updates(&self) -> Result<Option<Update>, UpdateError>;
       pub async fn download_and_install(&self, update: Update) -> Result<(), UpdateError>;
   }
   ```

5. **Telemetry System**
   ```rust
   // Add to oxide-core/src/telemetry.rs
   pub struct TelemetryManager {
       enabled: bool,
       endpoint: String,
       user_consent: bool,
   }
