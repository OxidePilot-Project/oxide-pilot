# üìê Oxide Pilot - Project Planning

## üéØ Vision & Objectives

Oxide Pilot represents the evolution of traditional system assistants towards a new era of **agent intelligence**. We combine the power and security of Rust with the most advanced conversational AI to create an assistant that doesn't just monitor your system, but **understands, learns, and acts** proactively.
