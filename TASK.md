## 🧠 Cognee Integration Plan (Feature-Gated)

The memory system now supports a pluggable backend via `oxide-memory/src/backend.rs` with a `MemoryBackend` trait. `CogneeBackend` is available behind the `cognee` feature and accessed from `MemoryManager` when enabled.

### ✅ What’s Done

- Implemented `MemoryBackend` trait and `CogneeBackend` implementation (feature-gated).
- Refactored `MemoryManager` to use optional backend while preserving JSON default behavior.
- Wired Tauri to initialize backend via env vars under the `cognee` feature in `src-tauri/src/oxide_system.rs`.
- Enabled `oxide-memory = { features = ["cognee"] }` in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.

### 🔜 In-Flight / Next Steps

- [ ] Config: Add persisted settings for Cognee (enable flag, URL, token) with secure storage (keyring) in `oxide-core`.
- [ ] UI: Add settings in `oxide-ui/AdvancedSettings.svelte` to toggle Cognee and edit URL/token.
- [ ] Sidecar: Implement supervised process management (start/stop/health, localhost bind, bearer token).
- [ ] Migration: One-click ingest of local JSON memory into Cognee using `backend.add_texts(...)`.
- [ ] Tests: Unit tests for mapping and error handling; integration tests with mock sidecar.
- [ ] Metrics: Add latency/availability metrics for backend; warn and auto-fallback to JSON on errors.
- [ ] Docs: Update developer guide for Cognee dev loop and packaging.

### 🔧 Runtime Behavior

- With feature compiled and `OXIDE_COGNEE_ENABLE=true|1`, Tauri initializes `MemoryManager::with_cognee(...)`.
- Writes are mirrored to Cognee best-effort; reads query Cognee first, fallback to local JSON.
- If feature not compiled or disabled, JSON backend remains the default.

### 🔐 Env Vars (for local dev)

- `OXIDE_COGNEE_ENABLE=true`
- `OXIDE_COGNEE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765`
- `OXIDE_COGNEE_TOKEN=<your-bearer-token>`

### ▶️ Dev Validation Commands

- Bridge: `cargo check -p oxide-cognee-bridge`
- Memory: `cargo check -p oxide-memory`
- App (w/ feature): ensure `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` enables `oxide-memory` with `features=["cognee"]`, then `cargo check -p oxide-pilot`

Note: If you encounter Windows file lock issues (os error 32) during build, simply re-run. If workspace dependency errors arise for other crates, pin their dependencies (avoid workspace-only manifests) or add a top-level Cargo workspace.
