# üìã Oxide Pilot - Project Rules & Guidelines

## üéØ Project Overview

**Oxide Pilot** is an advanced AI-powered system assistant with agentic capabilities, combining system monitoring, security EDR, and conversational AI. Built with a Rust backend using the Tauri framework and a Svelte frontend, it integrates Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, speech APIs, and a custom Cognee-based memory system.

**Status**: üü¢ Production Ready (92% Complete)  
**Architecture**: Dual-agent system (Guardian + Copilot)  
**Philosophy**: Open Core model with commercial AI layer

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Rules

### 1. Dual Agent System

- **Guardian Agent**: 24/7 background system monitoring and security
- **Copilot Agent**: On-demand conversational AI interface ("Hey, Oxide")
- Agents must operate independently but share context when needed
- Clear separation of concerns between monitoring and interaction

### 2. Technology Stack Requirements

- **Backend**: Rust only - no exceptions for core functionality
- **Frontend**: Svelte + Tauri for native cross-platform UI
- **AI Provider**: Google Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro) as primary
- **Memory System**: Cognee for cognitive knowledge architecture
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, Vector DB for contextual retrieval

### 3. Security-First Design

- Zero-trust architecture with granular permissions
- End-to-end encryption for all cloud communications
- Local processing for sensitive operations (wake word, system analysis)
- YARA-based malware detection with heuristic analysis
- Complete audit trail for all agent actions

---

## üîí Security Rules

### 1. Data Protection

- **Local First**: Sensitive system data never leaves the device
